This project was reated to be a helper to all my fellow FGV students who felt that opening the website to do FGV things was a little too troublesome...

This application (mobile+backend) **DOES NOT** store any of your credentials in any database.
We use the application memory and after you log out they are destroyed (I might store in you phone localstorage for better usability).

I **WILL NOT** use any of your information for any kind of usage.

The main goal of this app is: (this may change in the future)

- Go into fgv website, log in with your account grab your calendar information and then provide a service (for mobile use) to quicly access that calendar.

This is a open-source project and everyone is welcome to participate.
